# Install Tiny Best Set: GO!

{: .note }
It is recommended you download and install either the Tiny Best Set or the Done Set if you don't already have a ROM collection. As these sets share many of their games, don't install both or you might end up with multiple duplicate entries.

1. Download TBS. Again, I recommend **grabbing the torrent file and opening it through a client** like [qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download) to download the set. The TBS contains several files inside, you can pick which to download before starting the download. The main ones you want are:

## TBS Base package:
* `tiny-best-set-go-games.zip`
* `tiny-best-set-go-imgs-onion.zip`
* `tiny-best-set-go-arcade-names-onion.zip`

## TBS 64GB Expansion Pack:
* `tiny-best-set-go-expansion-64-games.zip`
* `tiny-best-set-go-expansion-64-imgs-onion.zip`

## TBS 128GB Expansion Pack:
* `tiny-best-set-go-expansion-128-games.zip`
* `tiny-best-set-go-expansion-128-imgs-onion.zip`

The TBS packs are **incremental**, that is, the full set requires the Base Pack, the 64GB Pack and the 128GB Pack. I recommend downloading all 7 zip files if your connection and storage allows for it. If not, download the first 5, or if you only want the bare minimum, download just the first 3 (note that the base pack contains no PS1, Sega CD or PC-Engine CD games).

2. When the download is done, **do the following for each of the ZIP files you downloaded** (so you’ll do this 7 times total if you downloaded the ones above):

    1. Open the ZIP file to see its contents. You should see 1 or 2 folders inside each, named `Roms` and `BIOS`.
    2. Drag both folders (or just the one) to the root of your SD card, which should have 2 folders (or one) with those same names. The contents of the ZIP file will merge with your SD card. If asked, choose to skip duplicate files.

3. Safely eject the SD card from your PC, insert it into your MM+ and turn it on. **Press `SELECT` in the main menu to refresh your ROMs**.

# You’re done! Happy gaming!
