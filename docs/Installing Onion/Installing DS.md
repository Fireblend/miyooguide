# Install Done Set

{: .note }
It is recommended you download and install either the Tiny Best Set or the Done Set if you don't already have a ROM collection. As these sets share many of their games, don't install both or you might end up with multiple duplicate entries.

1. Download `done-set.zip` from Internet Archive. It is recommended to **grab the torrent file and open it through a client** like [qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download) to download the set.

    Refer to the [Done Set's Starter Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rXswBhbYYEM1MP9jBoAohnm3g9zI8FKuhSXSCi3KMA/edit?usp=sharing) for bug fixes, updates and a full game list.

    Inside of `done-set.zip` you'll find the installation modules and extras in `.zip` format. These are already properly named and can be unzipped or transfered directly to the root of the SD card.

2. Start off by unzipping `Games + BIOS 32 GB (Base Set).zip` to the root of the SD card and choose to overwrite any files of the same name. This zipfile contains the `BIOS` folder and most of the games. **The other `.zip` files contain the rest of the games, as well as the optional configuration files.**

    The same procedure can be performed for each of the other zip files. Unzip or transfer the folders to the root of the SD card.

3. **There are three options for game preview artwork -** box art, mix of box art and screenshot and the default for Miyoo, a screenshot and game title sized to fit perfectly. Choose which one you want and unzip to the root of your SD card. If you want to try a different style, just overwrite the old one.

    The included config files and BIOS files were created while using Onion OS version `4.2.0-RC-snapshot-a5064207`. Later versions of Onion OS might have changes to the BIOS folder, RetroArch, etc. In this case, you can overwrite the BIOS folder with the one included in the updated Onion installation zip, or simply by using the `OTA update` app.

    The Cheats come with the same `retroarch.cfg` as the configs zip but with the cheats menu enabled. Unzip to root and overwrite, but do this last to ensure you have the correct `retroarch.cfg` in the end.

4. Safely eject the SD card from your PC, insert it into your Miyoo Mini and turn it on. **Press `SELECT` in the main menu to refresh your ROMs**.

# Youâ€™re done! Happy gaming!
