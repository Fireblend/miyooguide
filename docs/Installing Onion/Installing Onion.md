# Install Onion
1. Download the [latest release of Onion](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/releases) (scroll down a bit, expand the `Assets` section below the `changelog`, and download the `ZIP` File).

2. Move the ZIP file to the root directory of your SD card, right-click it and select `“Extract Here”`. Then delete the ZIP file. Your SD card’s root directory should now show several folders such as `Miyoo`, `media` and `BIOS`. **If you’re on Mac OS or Linux, make sure the `.tmp_update` folder is there**, as it may be hidden on those OSs.

3. Eject the SD card from your PC, insert it into your MM+ and turn it on. Installation should begin. During installation, you'll be given the chance to select which cores to activate (you can add/remove cores later).

If you’re using the TBS romset, make sure these cores are checked on the package manager:
