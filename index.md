# The No-Nonsense Miyoo Mini Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up your new Miyoo Mini Plus from scratch, filling it with ROMs and start playing in record time. This guide assumes you don’t have a ROM collection and that you will use the Tiny Best Set: Go! romset (also referred to as TBS in this document) as a starting point for games.

{: .warning }
It is recommended you Google the “Tiny Best Set” Internet Archive page for details. 
**This document has no links to pirated content.**

> This guide makes extensive use of the Onion Wiki content, the TBS documentation and other MM setup guides.

## Quick FAQ:
### What is Onion?
From the [Onion GitHub Page](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion): An enhanced operating system for your Miyoo Mini, featuring fine-tuned emulation with 100+ built-in emulators, auto-save and resume, a wealth of customization options, and much more. Performant, reliable, and straightforward retro gaming right in your pocket. [See official website for more details](https://onionui.github.io/).

### What is Tiny Best Set: GO?
Tiny Best Set: GO! Is a hand-curated set of games for the Miyoo Mini (running Onion). Optional preview images are included for each game and all necessary bios and configuration files are also included. You should be able to drag-and-drop everything on an SD card with a freshly installed version of Onion. I can’t link to it here due to it containing pirated content, but it’s easy enough to find [if you search](https://www.google.com/).

### Why do all this? Can’t I just stick with what came with my device?
The Miyoo Mini Plus is a fantastic device, however its out of the box experience is far from optimal. To begin with, the stock SD card it comes with is cheap trash that will sooner or later (very likely sooner) get corrupted and fail, the ROMs it includes are often riddled with issues and will freeze or not launch, and the default OS, while usable, doesn’t really maximize the capabilities of the hardware - Onion is a much more fully featured experience that really squeezes every drop of performance out of the device. So following this guide is very much worth it!
